```
Subject: SpinDance Code Challenge: AWS Credentials and GitHub ID

Hi <Candidate Name> - 

We are getting setup for the code challenge. Today I’m sending you some AWS credentials to at least try and login with. I want to be sure we have that working before we proceed. Next, we need to know a ~3 day period that would work for you to start the challenge. I will suggest Friday 5pm to Monday 9am seems to be good for most folks since it gives plenty of time to complete, and still has flexibility with what you may already have planned. Does this time work for you? Is there a better time period?
Attached is a CSV file containing the sign-in url, username, and password to sign in. You will be forced to reset your password on your first login. The CSV also contains the values for your Access Key ID and Secret Access Key. You should not need these for this particular challenge.

We will also need to know your github ID. Please include that in the reply to this email. If you don't yet have an account, please sign up for a free account.

Please let me know about timing of the challenge as well as confirm you can login with your AWS credentials

Thank you,
```

### Initiate the Challenge

1. On the agreed time, copy this repository to a new repository with the candidates name appended:
    ```
    git clone git@github.com:<user>/spindance.code-challenge
    cd spindance.code-challenge
    git remote set-url origin git@github.com:<user>/spindance.code-challenge.<candidate-id>
    git push origin master
    ```
1. Copy the internal files for the challenge account the candidate is using the following commands. 
This shows an example using data specific to the 'spindance-codechallenge2' account.
    ```
    cd <repo root>
    rm -r certificates
    cp -r .spindance-internal-only/spindance-codechallenge2/* .
    ```
1. Remove the internals directory (no real sensitive data here, but this helps with distraction)
    ```
    cd <repo root>
    rm -r .spindance-internal-only
    ```
1. Commit and push the changes
    ```
    git checkout master
    git add *
    git commit -m "configure for <candidate-id>"
    git push master
    ```
1. Send the following email to the candidate

    ```
    Subject: SpinDance Code Challenge: Good Luck!
    
    Hi <Candidate Name> - 
    
    We are excited to kick you off on the SpinDance code challenge. 
    You will receive an email notification shortly from github with a link to the code challenge repository.
    Read through the instructions and feel free to get started at any time. We ask that you complete your last commits
    no later than <end date time>. Please let me know if you have any access issues, or need clarifications.
    
    
    Thank you,
    ```
 1. Give the candidate access via their provided github id (Have Bruce fill in details here)
 
 ### Cleanup 
 
 1. The candidate copy of the repo should be kept until a hiring decision has been made. Once this 
 is done, archive the repo by creating a zip file and storing it in a Google Drive folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10pBfVMUwhgBv0QnDUAP_0olXyewEEx8M.
    1. Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:spindance/spindance.code-challenge.<candidate_id>.git`
    1. Change directory to the repo root.
    1. Archive to tar.gz archive: `git archive HEAD | gzip > /tmp/spindace.code-challenge.<candidate_id>.tar.gz`
    1. Upload to the shared folder
 1. Delete the private repository for the candidate
